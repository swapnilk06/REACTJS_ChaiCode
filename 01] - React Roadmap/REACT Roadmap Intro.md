# React JS - Chai Code
[Timeline : - ]


## 1] React Roadmap


### React - JavaScript Library  

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently react is famous in market but before, react in market many option jquery, backboneJS...etc.
> - Market demand always change.

<br>

- [x] Why React learn?
- Justify which time react we required?
	- React JS use to `make easy to manage & build complex frontend.`
- React compiler in HTML, CSS, JS (Browser known only that)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Use of React sense in `building of complex frontend`.
> - Many things changes at 1 time.

<br>

- [x] When should learn React?
- Before learn any `library` or `framework` mastery in JS -
	- Thread execution, Execution context, how to go in memory, function execution, DOM execution... etc
	- We mastry in `building any in javascript` (without React or any library)

<br>

- [x] What React was created?
- In facebook solve `fantom/Ghost message problem` 
	- After message read also showing we don't read that
- What problem?
	- Our `state` manage by --> `JS`
	`State` is fancy name for all javascript variable
	- Our `UI` manage by --> DOM
	- `No consistency in UI`.
- React come for solving conversion or sync in between of `JS & DOM`
- `State management` in same time in multiple places & `consistency in UI`.

<br>

- [x] Don't learn React if :
- Don't know how JS works OR DOM works
	- How woek in single tread, What Global conext, Execution context...


<br>

- [x] React is a library?
- Framework : Military 
	- Rules for naming convension file/folder, data fetching..
	- E.g. Django Framwork, NextJS Framework
- Library : Cool Dude
	- More freedom for work
	- E.g. React Library (small concept in that)


<br>

- [x] Topic to learn?
- Core of React (State OR UI manipulation, JSX)
	- In react changing state not reflect in UI that learn in `Core`.
	- `JSX` --> We write `HTML in JavaScript`.
- Component Reusability
	- How reuse single created button, card header, footer in mutiple places
- Reusing of Component (Props)
	- Properties --> Key & Values in that{ --- }
- How to propagate change (hooks)
	- usestate, useEffect
	- Not learn all hooks `only learn hooks concepts`

### SPA in React 
- Single page application without reloading page.
	- How to go new URL without page reloading i.e. that time `manipulation work`


- [x] Additional Addon to React
- Router (React don't have Router)
- State management (React don't have State management - currently present that)
	- Some libraries are introduce that `JS Library` (not React library)
		- Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
- Class based component
	- legacy code (bad thing)
- BAAS Apps
	- Appweite, firebase, superbase (directly used backend)
		- Directly using BAAS app build :- social media clone, e-commerce


<br>

- [x] What next after React?
- React is not a complete solution in most case
	- no seo, browser render issue of JS, no routing
- Switch to Framwork
	- NextJS, Gatsby, Remix
